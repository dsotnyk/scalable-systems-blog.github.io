Be professional and use common sense is my best principle I can share with you.

#### Be friendly, patient and respectful

All people have unique skillset, techstack and level of understanding of various topics. Disagreement is not a reason for poor ar disrespectful behavior.

#### Stay on target

I value other opinions in other areas, but this the technical blog.

#### No-hair theorem

The only things which is important here is the technical knowledge and technical experience.

In his/here professional role, engineer have no race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, mental and physical ability.

So, any pullrequests with discussion or even declaration of such things will not be merged, except very neutral bio.

Includes, but is not limited to:
    - Violent threats or language;
    - Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language;
    - Sexually explicit or violent material and behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention.;
    - Posting, or threatening to post, people's personally identifying information ("doxing");
