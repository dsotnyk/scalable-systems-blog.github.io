The real mystery of IT world is that a lot of presale people have very basic understanding of technical side of presale. In the same time, technical specialists often have just basic understanding of what is presale and proposal, what is important and why, and what is to presale/proposal lifecycle.

I’ll try to summarize what I know about presale process and common mistakes. Hope that this material will be a good starting point. 

* TOC
{:toc}

# Target audience #
This is description of presale process mostly from the point of view of technical specialist, responsible for technical side of proposal (technical lead of presale). In the same time, as the owner of IT company in the past, I will overview and briefly explain the rest of the presale process.

Information from these articles may be interesting for presale persons and management, who want to get better understanding of the technical side of a presale, how proposal should be created, how to interact with technical specialists on both sides of the process and what are the common mistakes.

Nevertheless, main purpose of these articles is to share knowledge with technical leads, involved in presale, about what is presale and how to deal with it.

# Limits of applicability #

In this discussion we will discuss part of the presale process in **outsource service model**, when we need to propose to customer **technical solution** and **service of a team**, to implement it.

We will be focused on **proposal** lifecycle, from a first contact and to post-presentation phase: typical issues.

We will discuss presale which is built on “fair play” principles, when company have real expertise and value for the client.

# What is Presale and Who is Presale Lead #

Presale is a **process** or a set of **activities** normally carried out **before a customer is acquired**, though sometimes presales also extends into the period the product or service is delivered to the customer

Zone of responsibility of a **presale person** (**presale lead** in our discussion) starts from the initial contact phase and often ends once the customer is acquired i.e. sale is made. In some cases, presale person also provide some initial or transitional support post-sale.

Responsibilities of Presale Leads differs from organization to organization, but in general includes:

1. Solution/Proposal Preparation based on Customers Requirements
1. Proof of Concept creation process
1. Marketing Documents
1. Product or Solution demonstrations
1. ... and any other activity required to make a deal

In Software Industry and IT Services Industry products and services are often very different from client to client. So, role of presale lead is to match client's need to a company's services or products. 

**Presale lead** should:
   - understand client's needs 
   - develop an initial solution (choose product or service of his company to meet this need)
   - bring it and explain to a customer
   - help to enclose a deal
   - and often continue to be involved to ensure that the delivery team or product specialists follow solution and agreement made. 

As you can see, it's a lot for a single person, it requires collaboration and usually leads to numerous mistakes.

Areas of which belongs to Presale Lead are:

1. **Discovery** – identify business problem. Should understand client's business and be able to analyse requirements.
1. **Request for Proposal (RFP)** – should have a detailed knowledge of the products / services and understand business problems. Frequently involved in technical side of RFP document preparation.
1. **Preparation** – create presentation or software presentation that precisely meets the client's needs.
1. **Demonstration** – A demonstration of a product/service. Should be done in a way that highlights a method to solve business problem using the tools available within the vendors suite of product. (yes, yes, this is obvious, but a lot of people made presentation just wit "we can do this and that or have this and that skills or engineers")
1. **Proposal assistance** – involved from discovery of the prospect business problems, will often help with business analysis and technical component of proposal.

# What is Proposal #

In general, proposal is a **document** that lists and defines the technical requirements of a contract or project, and explains the approach, plan and cost estimate.

Proposal answers questions about **what** is proposed, **which problem (why)** will be solved, **how** to do it **(schedule and resources)** and **how much** it is going to cost.

Level of details should match technical level and role of key decision makers. It is recommended to divide document onto executive summary, written in non-technical language, but with required information to make decision and technical part, focused on details of implementation.

Usually proposal need to be reviewed and approved before it will be shown to a customer.

It’s highly recommended to have two different review sessions: 

* technical review of “**what** is proposed and **which problem (why)** will be solved” section with technical leads and/or architects
* overall review with management, who is responsible for resources and finances, so CEO and CFO or their representatives need to be involved.


# Common mistakes while presale process #

This is the incomplete list of mistakes I’ve seen personally when was involved in presales. Most of them looks like just violation of the common sense, but it's my real-world experience.

## Process
  
Most critical issues are often result of malformed process or even absence of a process. Most of the time such issues can be fixed easily with clear and simple process improvement.

##### 1. No process at all
  
*There is no greater evil than anarchy - Sophocles*  

A lot of presale started with no formal process definition.

**As a result** it’s hard to manage and coordinate work while presale and proposal lifecycle, assign work and responsibilities. Chaos as we know it.

##### 2. No requirements to artifacts
  
There is no list of expected outcome (artifacts) and/or requirements to such artifacts, intermediate and final.

**As a result:**  
- hard to manage and coordinate work due to lack of visibility and information, because many intermediate artifacts like PoC reports, Request for Proposal, activity logs etc. are not created at all  
- a lot of valuable information lost after presale and can’t be reused
- final artifacts (proposal) may not satisfy requirements

##### 3. No post-mortem analyze, so no process improvements
  
*“Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it.” ― Edmund Burke*

Post-mortem analyze of presale results and a whole activity is a mandatory step to understand reasons of success or fail and improve process for better results. 

Unfortunately, this step is often omitted and many companies have no presale statistics at all.

**As a result**, many companies have no understanding of how efficient their presale process and is it need to be improved. Without process improvement same issues affects presale process again and again.

##### 4. No fail-fast
  
*A fail-fast system is designed to immediately report at its interface any failure or condition that is likely to lead to failure. Fail-fast systems are usually designed to stop normal operation rather than attempt to continue a possibly flawed process. Such designs often check the system's state at several points in an operation, so any failures can be detected early*

Absence of intermediate waypoints, when team should analyze presale state and results and decide, should they continue presale activity or it should be canceled or restarted with a new information (requirements, team, customer etc.)

Presale process is an **expensive procedure**. Also resources and experts used in presale process are limited. So fail-fast pattern may help to free such resources for other presale activities.

**As a result** of this mistake, companies spend a lot of resources and time to unpromising presale projects and realize this too late. This also means that some other presale projects will not be started due to lack of resources.

##### 5. There is no assigned person who will lead technical activity
  
I don’t know why, but this is very common issue. 

Usually, there is no single responsible person who will lead technical activity on presale and will be responsible for technical part of proposal and coordinate technical work.

**As a result**, presale person (presale lead) is trying to manage technical activity (investigation, PoC, creation/support of the technical part of proposal etc.) and even discuss technical questions on meetings.

##### 6. More than one technical specialists involved without explicit assignment to lead technical activity
  
That’s odd, but next common mistake is (and moreover, they frequently can be met together!) to involve few experts and do not assign a formal leader.

**As a result**, such specialists do not interact with each other and do not coordinate activity at all. This also lead to HUGE mess on a meetings with a client.

If presale lead will try to manage such technical work personally, usually he/she-will be overloaded with technical questions he/she is not familiar with. Otherwise, result will depend on the ability of a newly created “team” to self-organize from Day 1 (you know, how real is this).

##### 7. Overcomplicated process
  
*The worst thing in this world, next to anarchy, is government. - Henry Ward Beecher*

Opposite side of 1 it’s overcomplicated process or process, which can’t be understood without long training.

**As a result**, such process will be simply ignored by all or (what is even worse) by some participants. On the other hands, following to such process will dramatically decrease performance and motivation.

I met this in companies with no post-mortem analyze practice. 

##### 8. No any structured information storage 
  
*Most of the great written sources appear to represent the final stage of a long oral tradition - History of Humanity: From the 3rd millenium to the 7th century B.C.*

Last (but not least) process-related problem is absence of storage to store/exchange artifacts and information.

Sometimes there is no any other source of an information than memories of participants and no other way to exchange documents than mailthreads. A lot of information simply not reflected in any written source and lost.

**As a result** of such terrible approach, work on presale is complicated and most of an information can’t be recovered and reused after presale.

## First contact with a Client
  
Few mistakes which usually occurs on the first steps of presale process. Usually it’s a result of process and roles assignment violation.

##### 9. No demonstration of the vendor product that specifically addresses the prospects business problems
  
Presale process includes a demonstration step of a product / service that specifically addresses business problems. It need to be done in a way that highlights an easiest method to solve these problems using the tools available from vendor.

Sometimes this step is ignored partially (when no materials related and specific to customer’s business problem is shown) or completely (when no any materials about company presented)

**As a result** it is hard to enclose a deal or even establish close contact to understand customer’s needs and create Request for Proposal at first steps.

##### 10. A lot of technical specialists on a first meeting, who are not prepared, had no relation to a project and, actually, should not be involved
  
*To be, or not to be, that is the question -  William Shakespeare*

It’s hard to say, is this a such strange presale strategy or attempt to compensate lack of preparation by involving multiple technical specialists, who are not prepared, to a first meeting with customer. 

Usually such specialists (skilled, experienced and with high grades) have no specific knowledges, related to customer’s needs and not prepared to such meeting.

**As a result** of such approach, few technical specialists start to ask ask questions in a chaotic manner even before demonstration of company’s information and experience in the area. 

Maybe this is just another presale strategy, but in combination with Mistakes #5 and #6 result are below expected.

## Wrong presale steps order
  
Presale process it’s a sequence of a steps, where proper order of a steps is important to avoid unneeded effort.

##### 11. Start technical activity and analyze even before first contact, immediately after discovery step
  
Sometimes technical investigation (with dedicated resources!) and analyze started immediately after discovery, before first contact meeting and real information about customer’s needs.

In combination with Mistakes #5, #6 and #10 result is overwhelmingly terrible, because even if research occasionally matched real customer’s needs, there is no chance to use such research results on a meeting due to absence of coordination between meeting participants. Most of them may be even not aware about the fact of such research.

**Result** of this mistake are resources spent for nothing but demotivation of participants of such research.

##### 12. Difference between task definition from initial contact person and decision maker when starting analyze before Request for Proposal.
  
Commonly used presale sequence requires to start investigation only after all decision makers and knowledge sources are identified, presales have a detailed knowledge about customer’s needs, Request for Proposal is created and reviewed by customer.

Violation of this rule may lead to research with wrong or incomplete information.

**Result** of this mistake are resources spent for nothing and demotivation of participants of such research.

## Improper resources assignment
  
Every step in presale process may require dedicated resources to complete or can be done in background. Improper resources assignment leads to few common mistakes.

##### 13. No assigned resources to make investigation, PoC and create proposal
  
Sometimes presale project have no (enough or at all) assigned resources to make investigation, create PoC and work on proposal document. In such situations technical specialists which are full-time busy on existing project may be involved to work on proposal in background or even in a free time.

Such approach may be acceptable in case of emergencies, but as a systematic approach it’s a huge impact to performance and motivation of people involved, existing project delivery and also seriously affects proposal and presale results.

##### 14. Overuse of dedicated resources
  
Opposite side to the previous mistake is excessive use of dedicated resources while presale.

This can be improper activity like analyze or PoC etc. (see 11 for example) or use of dedicated resources for steps, which can be done by presale lead only or by other participants in background.

**As a result** of this mistake resources will be spent for nothing, this will increase presale cost or block other presale project due to lack of resources.

## Communication
  
##### 15. No close contact between company’s technical specialists and customer’s technical specialists and management
  
In fact, presale process (in our case) mostly based on ability to show to a client vendor's expertise and explain solution, with all risks, pros and cons. 

So it’s continuous process, from the first meeting and up to sale, where sale it’s a final step only.

**As a result**, absence of close contact between vendor’s technical specialists and clients’s technical specialists and management impacts understanding of clients’s needs and technical limitations as well as overall presale process


# Presale Technical Leader role in details#

If Presale Lead (Sales Person) requires technical assistance, it is highly recommended from my experience to define Presale Technical Lead role, even if this is single technical person.

**Presale Technical Leader (TL)** is a person, responsible for a whole technical area of Presale activity. 

### Key points

This is a single and primary contact person and decision maker for any questions related to Presale technical activity.

TL works with and managed by a person, who leads a whole Presale (Presale Lead, Client Partner etc.).

TL is assigned to particular Presale project and works on it from the early beginning and until project will be finished.

### Responsibilities

TL is responsible for:  
- Technical investigations, PoC and required documentation and presentations  
- Technical part of proposal document  
- Estimates  
- Form, control and manage team to make investigation or PoC (if required).  
- All technical questions, internal or from client’s side  
- Technical part of any meeting while Presale (if meeting is technical only - will lead such meetings)  
- Documentation of all technical solutions made and log of technical work to keep information available while and after presale process  
- Communication with a client to get, clarify and discuss requirements, then to present technical part of proposal  
- Take participation in daily communication with customer  
- Take participation in post-mortem analyse  
- In case of assignment canceled by Presale Lead, transfer all knowledges to newly assigned TL  

### Rights

First and most important right of potential TL is to decline assignment.

Presale Lead may discuss any questions with TL, but only TL makes final decisions on:  
- who and when need to be involved to presale process for technical area  
- when to start PoC, which questions need to be covered and how many details need to be provided.  
- who and when will work on technical part of proposal and which topics and how need to be covered  

### Required skills and qualities

Accordingly to responsibilities we can define required skills for TL:  
- Quick learning  
- Fluent english  
- At least basic knowledges in proposal’s area  
- Ability to get/clarify/discuss requirements  
- Communication skills to interact with customer and team  
- Responsibility and ability to plan own work  
- Ability to work proactively and without constant control  
- Basic management skills to organize work of involved technical specialists is a plus, but additional manager can be involved instead.  

Also we can define required qualities  
- Be mature and wise enough to keep balance between following current priorities and limitations and what is required for success   
- Be able to work with current Presale Lead  

### Who can play this role

TL is a person with broad responsibility and some irrevocable rights, so need to be chosen very carefully.

Many Architects, Technical Leads and Development Managers may meet those requirements. Also some BA can be involved.
